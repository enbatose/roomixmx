<h2>Description</h2>
Roomix.Mx was a marketplace platform focused on facilitating the process of finding a tenant to share a property; an appartment or a house. Roomix.Mx was created in 2013 to address a gap in the existing platforms in Mexico where competitors focused on a generic "Craigslist" approach with a poor user interface for the posts, search and aggresive monetization models. 

Roomix centered the marketplace objects in the experience that Roomate seekers live while on their search for a new roomate or a room in a property. The characteristics for publications which enable better search criteria was:

- Gender
- Age
- Budget
- Affinity Tags (E.g. University or Employer)
- Location

The latter one, **Location** acted as the center of the GUI for searching appartments via a map with pins for available publications, unlike already existing post listing. A map interface was prioritized as our interviews with customers and observed user behavior revealed that other important factors such as price and appereance of the property (Photos) became more flexible relative to location.

<h2>Business Model</h2>

**Founders**: [Enrique Batani Oseguera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enriquebatani/) and [Jesus Mario Verdugo Cedeno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmverdugo/).

The platform was intended to operate first in Guadalajara, Mexico. The second largest city in the country and home of ~7M people. Then eventually include other major cities in the country and other potential areas. 

The **monetization** strategy was a Fremium model where the basic free users would be able to create publications and contact owners of publications, which were actioned blocked by competitors at that time behind a paywall. Then, the premium users would would upgrade to an "It's urgent" profile which depending on the user persona.

1. Room Seeker: Suscription to receive email and chat notifications about new publications meeting their criteria.
2. Tenants: Higher visibility on top of the announcements when displayed in list mode, and special pin on the map interface. Also, the ability to open conversations with Room Seekers based on matching property criteria.

The **platform was closed** in 2015 due to shifting priorities. Then from 2019 to 2020 Enrique Batani relaunched the platform with a focus on property content quality developing features focused on describing common areas vs dedicated room areas and multi-room properties targeting recurrent users as interviews revealed were part of the ecosystem. The platform operations were closed due to complications during the pandemic.
