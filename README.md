## 💡 Description: Roomix.Mx

Roomix.Mx was a **specialized marketplace platform** launched in 2013 to streamline the process of finding a **compatible roommate** to share a rental property (apartment or house) in Mexico.

It was created to address a significant gap in the existing market. Competitors at the time utilized a generic, "Craigslist-style" approach characterized by poor user interfaces for searching and posting, coupled with aggressive monetization models.

Roomix differentiated itself by placing the **roommate-seeking experience** at the core of the platform. Key publication characteristics were implemented to enable superior search and matching criteria:

* **Location:** This was the central element of the graphical user interface (GUI), featuring a map with pins for available listings, a departure from standard post listings. This focus was based on customer interviews and observed behavior, which indicated that location was often the most critical factor, making price and property appearance (photos) more flexible in comparison.
* **Gender**
* **Age**
* **Budget**
* **Affinity Tags** (e.g., University or Employer)

## 💰 Business Model and History

**Founders**: [Enrique Batani Oseguera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enriquebatani/) and [Jesus Mario Verdugo Cedeno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmverdugo/).

### Launch & Market Focus

The platform initially targeted **Guadalajara, Mexico**, the country's second-largest city with approximately 7 million residents, with eventual plans to expand to other major national and regional cities.

### Monetization Strategy

Roomix employed a **Freemium model**. Basic users could post listings and contact property owners—actions often blocked behind competitor paywalls. Premium users were offered an **"It's Urgent"** upgrade with features tailored to their persona:

1.  **Room Seekers:** Subscription to receive immediate email and chat notifications about new listings matching their criteria.
2.  **Tenants (Property Owners):** Higher visibility in list mode and a distinct pin on the map interface. They also gained the ability to initiate conversations with Room Seekers based on matching property criteria.

### Success and Re-launch

* **Peak Performance (Initial Run):** In its first year, Roomix peaked with over **100 active property publications** and more than **1,000 users**, facilitating over **~20 successful rental agreements per month**.
* **Initial Closure:** The platform was closed in **2015** due to shifting priorities.
* **Relaunch (2019-2020):** Enrique Batani relaunched the platform, shifting focus to **property content quality**. New features were developed to clearly distinguish between common areas and dedicated room areas in multi-room properties, targeting recurrent users identified through interviews.
* **Final Closure:** Operations were ultimately closed in **2020** due to complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
